            <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
            <p>College life can be expensive, and often, students find themselves with items they no longer use or need. At the same time, many others are looking for affordable second-hand options. Our purpose is to bridge this gap by creating a safe and user-friendly marketplace where students can post and discover items like textbooks, appliances, furniture, and more.</p>
